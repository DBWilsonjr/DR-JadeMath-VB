# DR-JadeMath-VB
Another program written for the mobile game Dungeon Rush

Created March '16.

A fun little program designed to tell you how many of a lower level jade it will take to create higher level jade. Calculations are done based on level 3 jade because those can be purchased with in-game currency and combined to reach the higher levels.

Small quirk: The math is pretty wrong. I'm thinking of rewriting things with an array so that more jade already owned can be taken into account (as it should be) and for the challenge of it all.
